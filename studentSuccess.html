      <p>In early August, I chose to complete the entirety of my junior year as a virtual student. So, here are the tips that I have taken up to ensure my junior year is a success.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left"><b>Routine:</b> This is by far the most important tip. I wake up at a consistent time as if I was going to physical school. I also make sure to change out of my pajamas and into something that I feel prepares me for the day.
      <br><b>Time Blocking:</b> With being a virtual student comes a lot of freedom. I try to plan how I will tackle assignments by assigning chunks of time to complete them.
      <br><b>Finding Community:</b> Virtual learning can foster isolation. So, my friends and I decided to meet virtually at least once a week just to have fun whether itâ€™s playing Skribbl.io or Among Us.
